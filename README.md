## Get started (How to run the project)

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

## My Approach

I began by analyzing the project requirements and breaking them down into manageable tasks. I followed React Native best practices to ensure proper usage of the framework. I focused on writing clean, well-organized code and structuring components for clarity and reusability. For UI/UX fidelity, I aimed to closely match the design while maintaining responsiveness and interactive elements. State management was handled with a predictable approach (React Context) to maintain clarity and reliability throughout the app.
